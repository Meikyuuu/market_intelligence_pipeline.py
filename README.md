# Automated Market Intelligence Pipeline

### **Project Overview**
This project is a production-grade **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline designed to automate the collection and analysis of global market data. It bridges high-level **Business Economics** logic with **Python-driven automation** to provide actionable financial insights in real-time.

### **Core Capabilities**
* **Automated Extraction:** Programmatically retrieves live market data via the Yahoo Finance API (yfinance).
* **Business Transformation:** Implements custom logic to calculate price momentum and volatility indicators, mimicking analytical standards used at firms like **FactSet**.
* **Data Delivery:** Automatically generates a structured `.csv` report for stakeholder review, replacing hours of manual data entry with a 5-second execution.
* **Engineering Reliability:** Built with robust **Error Handling** and **Logging** to ensure pipeline stability in a professional environment.

### **The "Why" Behind This Project**
Coming from a 4-year background at **Aon** and **FactSet**, I recognized that manual data processing is the biggest bottleneck in global finance. This project demonstrates my ability to:
1.  **Automate** repetitive reporting tasks.
2.  **Translate** complex economic theories into scalable code.
3.  **Scale** insights across multiple global tickers (NASDAQ, NYSE, ASX) simultaneously.

### **Tech Stack**
* **Language:** Python 3.10+
* **Environment:** Google Colab / Local IDE
* **Libraries:** * `Pandas`: For data manipulation and structured reporting.
    * `yfinance`: For real-time API integration.
    * `Logging`: For enterprise-grade process tracking.
